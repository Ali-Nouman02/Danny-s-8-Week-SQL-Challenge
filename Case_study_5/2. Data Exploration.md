###  1. What day of the week is used for each week_date value?

```sql
SELECT 
    DISTINCT(DAYNAME(week_date)) AS 'day_of_week'
FROM clean_weekly_sales;
``` 
	
#### Result set:
![question 1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d68b8a64-afaf-44aa-bffb-54b0bf96acbd)

***

###  2. What range of week numbers are missing from the dataset? 
- To get the current value of default_week_format variable : SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'default_week_format';

```sql
SELECT 
	DISTINCT(week_number)
FROM clean_weekly_sales
ORDER BY week_number
;

-- missing weeks are (1-11) and (37-52)
``` 
	
#### Result set:

###  3. How many total transactions were there for each year in the dataset?

```sql
SELECT 
	YEAR(week_date) AS 'YEAR',
	SUM(transactions) AS 'count'
FROM clean_weekly_sales
GROUP BY YEAR(week_date);
``` 
	
#### Result set:

###  4. What is the total sales for each region for each month?

```sql
SELECT 
	region,
	CONCAT(SUM(sales),'$') AS 'total_sales'
FROM clean_weekly_sales
GROUP BY region;

``` 
	
#### Result set:

***

###  5. What is the total count of transactions for each platform 

```sql
SELECT
	platform,
	SUM(transactions) AS 'transaction_count'
FROM clean_weekly_sales
GROUP BY platform;
``` 
	
#### Result set:

![question 5](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3a5301ed-a2e0-4bd4-9f54-f58bd6423b34)

###  6. What is the percentage of sales for Retail vs Shopify for each month?


```sql
SELECT 
    month_number,
    CONCAT(ROUND(SUM(IF(platform = 'Retail', sales, 0)) / NULLIF(SUM(sales), 0) * 100, 2), '%') AS Retail_Percentage,
    CONCAT(ROUND(SUM(IF(platform = 'Shopify', sales, 0)) / NULLIF(SUM(sales), 0) * 100, 2), '%') AS Shopify_Percentage
FROM 
    clean_weekly_sales
GROUP BY 
    month_number
ORDER BY 
    month_number;
``` 

``` 
	
#### Result set:

![question 6](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7cb0a644-3d24-4921-bee2-d8ab344d2734)

***

###  7. What is the percentage of sales by demographic for each year in the dataset?

```sql
WITH CTE AS (
	SELECT 
		YEAR(week_date) AS 'Year',
		demographic,
		SUM(sales) AS 'sales_per_group',
		SUM(SUM(sales)) OVER () AS 'total_sales'
	FROM clean_weekly_sales
	GROUP BY YEAR(week_date), demographic
)
 SELECT 
	Year,
    demographic,
	CONCAT(ROUND((sales_per_group / total_sales) * 100,2), '%') AS 'percentage'
 FROM CTE;
``` 

#### Result set:

![question 7](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e0313e1d-f912-448c-9977-14ca170a0e68)


***

###  8. Which age_band and demographic values contribute the most to Retail sales?

```sql
WITH CTE AS (
	SELECT 
		age_band,
		demographic,
		SUM(sales) AS 'sales_per_group',
		SUM(SUM(sales)) OVER () AS 'total_sales'
	FROM clean_weekly_sales
	WHERE platform = 'Retail'
	GROUP BY age_band, demographic
	ORDER BY SUM(sales) DESC
) 
SELECT 
	age_band,
    demographic,
    CONCAT(ROUND((sales_per_group / total_sales) * 100,2), '%' ) AS 'percentage_of_retail_sales'
FROM CTE
LIMIT 2
;
``` 
	
#### Result set:

![question 8](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/505ce9e9-7cc4-4922-bf5a-cc175ce7221a)

###  9. Can we use the avg_transaction column to find the average transaction size for each year for Retail vs Shopify? If not - how would you calculate it instead?
