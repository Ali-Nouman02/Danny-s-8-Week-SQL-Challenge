## :shopping_cart: Case Study #5: Data Mart - Data Cleansing Steps

In a single query, perform the following operations and generate a new table in the data_mart schema named clean_weekly_sales:

- Convert the week_date to a DATE format
- Add a **week_number** as the second column for each week_date value, for example any value from the 1st of January to 7th of January will be 1, 8th to 14th will be 2 etc
- Add a **month_number** with the calendar month for each week_date value as the 3rd column
- Add a **calendar_year** column as the 4th column containing either 2018, 2019 or 2020 values
- Add a new column called **age_band** after the original segment column using the following mapping on the number inside the segment value

- Add a new **demographic** column using the following mapping for the first letter in the segment values

- Ensure all null string values with an "unknown" string value in the original segment column as well as the new age_band and demographic columns
- Generate a new **avg_transaction** column as the sales value divided by transactions rounded to 2 decimal places for each record

```sql
CREATE TABLE clean_weekly_sales AS
SELECT 
	STR_TO_DATE(week_date, '%d/%c/%y')  AS week_date,
    WEEK(week_date) AS week_number,
    MONTH(week_date) AS month_number,
	CONCAT(20, RIGHT(week_date,2)) AS calendar_year,
    CASE 
		WHEN segment = 'null' THEN 'unknown'
        ELSE segment
	END AS segment,
    CASE 
		WHEN RIGHT(segment,1) = '1' THEN 'Young Adults'
        WHEN RIGHT(segment,1) = '2' THEN 'Middle Aged'
        WHEN RIGHT(segment,1) IN ('3','4') THEN 'Retirees'
        WHEN segment = 'null' OR segment IS NULL THEN 'unknown'
        ELSE 'unknown'
	END AS age_band,
     CASE 
		WHEN LEFT(segment,1)= 'C' THEN 'Couples'
        WHEN LEFT(segment,1)= 'F' THEN 'Families'
        WHEN segment = 'null' THEN 'unknown'
	END AS demographic,
    CONCAT(ROUND(sales/transactions,2), '$') AS 'avg_transactions',
    transactions, 
    CONCAT(sales, '$') AS sales,
    region,
    platform
FROM weekly_sales;
```

***

```sql
SELECT *
FROM clean_weekly_sales;
``` 
#### Result set:
![new table](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7cf86cf9-cd17-4276-bbb8-a392336eafcf)
